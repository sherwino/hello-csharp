# hello-csharp
Learning C#, so I figured I should make a repo with my hello world program, and keep track of some of the concepts learned.

## GradeBook

In this "Solution" I am going to try to build a:

A electronic grade book to read the scores of an individual student and then compute some simple statistics from the scores. 
The grades are entered as floating point numbers from 0 to 100, and the statistics shoulw show us the highest grade, the lowest grade, and the average grade.
